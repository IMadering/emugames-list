The objective of this game is to guess the sequence of four numbered pegs selected at random by the computer. Start guessing the sequence of the four numbered pegs by inputting in your guess at the bottom. For each correct number, the player will be awarded a grey peg; and if both the number and the location are correct, a black peg will be awarded. However, the player will not be informed of which peg and which location is correct, so the winning strategy involves critical thinking and logical analysis to deduce the possible combination. The game ends when either the player guesses the correct combination with six or few guesses, or when the computer reveals the answer after the sixth incorrect guess.
