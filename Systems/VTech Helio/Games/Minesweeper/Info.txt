MineSweeper is a game of strategy and deductive reasoning. The screen is in grids with hidden landmines and the objective of the game is to safely uncover all the tiles without setting off any landmines. The information on the right side keeps track of the elapsed time and the number of mines still hidden in the 9 x 12 grid. Put the cursor onto the tile and click on it to see whether there is a landmine hidden underneath. If the tile turns grey, that means there is no landmine in the vicinity. The numbers 1 to 8 on some times indicate the number of land mines in the neighbourhood. When a safe tile is uncovered, the other safe tiles in the area will automatically reveal themselves. The game ends when a landmine explodes or when the player has successfully avoided all landmines.
