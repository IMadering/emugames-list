Stella is an emulator of the Atari 2600 game console, and takes its name from the console's codename. It is open-source, and runs on most major modern platforms including Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Stella started development in late 1995.

The emulator supports all Atari 2600 cartridge bank switching schemes and has support for nearly all Atari 2600 titles. It has cycle-exact emulation for the TIA chip (graphics and sound); the Stella Team estimates that current TIA emulation is nearing 100% completion.

Stella supports cassette games designed to work with the Starpath Supercharger and also supports games designed to work with the Spectravideo Compumate and Coleco KidVid.
