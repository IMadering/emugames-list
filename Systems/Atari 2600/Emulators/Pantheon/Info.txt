Pantheon is Windows desktop application with collection of games for video consoles and home computers from the past. The games are not the part of the application, instead they will be downloaded (with the game manual or review - if available) from the internet, after you activate the game for the first time. Downloaded files are stored on the local file system (in user application data folder), and will be available offline the next time you wish to play the game. Finally, the program file is loaded and executed in the emulator of specific device. You can also check a variation of Pantheon for the Web, with not so many games as the Pantheon has, but you can play theses games in your web browser on any platform, even on mobile platforms.
