Considering we're a longplay channel, you'll find that all of our videos are without commentary. Generally it's one video per game, but sometimes we're restricted to certain upload limits. As an archive, we're very strict on maintaining a certain quality format and making sure all of our gameplay is recorded under the same guidelines. Meaning, we record all of the meaningful and unique content. Sometimes this means our games are completed a 100%, sometimes it doesn't.
