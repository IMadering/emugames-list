Beat your opponent in the Japanese version of chess played on a 9x9 square board. Shogi distinguishes from other chess variations by its 'parachuting rule': the pieces taken from the opponent can be used as reinforcements. Each player's goal is to attack the enemy king so that the king cannot prevent the attack or escape. When a king is attacked, it is in check. The player whose king is in check must attempt to escape on the next move. If he can't do this, the king is checkmated. The player who is checkmated loses. If players play the time-limited game, it is over when any player exceeds this time and accordingly loses.
