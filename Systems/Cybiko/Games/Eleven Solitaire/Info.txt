This solitaire is played with one full deck (52 cards).
Cards are played disregarding their suits. Eleven cards form two rows, then the player searches these cards for the two that, if their ranks are added, will equal 11 points. If such cards are found, they get dropped and, possibly, replaced with the next two cards from the deck.
Ace (1 point) can be dropped with the ten. King, Queen, and Jack can be dropped altogether.
You win the game by dropping all the cards.
