Tommy Solitaire is an ancient solitaire, probably the oldest of all known.

This solitaire is played with one full deck (52 cards). You start by turning over the cards, one at a time, from the stock. When you move it onto the suit stack, you have to move all other cards on these suit stacks, in ascending order. If you cannot play a card on either suit stack, you play it on either of four auxiliary stacks. You cannot move cards between auxiliary stacks, though you can play a card from an auxiliary stack on the suit stack by moving all the cards on their respective suit stack.

You win the game by moving all the cards on their respective suit stacks. The deck can be looked through one time only.

Note: You will not want to play a card from the deck on an auxiliary stack which already contains (probably deep inside) the card of lower rank but the same suit - e.g., queen of spades on the stack containing the seven of spades. In such a case, you will definitely lose the game. Instead, you will want to collect (in each auxiliary stack) cards of each suit in descending order. In spite of such a simple rules, this solitaire is very challenging, since taking this hint into account requires exceptionally good memory.
