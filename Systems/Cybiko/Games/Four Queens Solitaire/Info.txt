Four Queens are the fundamental cards in this interesting solitaire game.

This solitaire is played with one full deck (52 cards).
Gray "fake" cards show the Queens layout. When all Queens are laid out, other "fake" cards appear - fives and sixes. When the fives and sixes are laid out, other cards can be played on fives in descending order, on sixes in ascending order, and Kings can be played on Queens.

You win the game by ending up with stacks of fives and sixes (i.e., stacks started with sixes - with Jack, and stacks of fives - with King or Ace).
The deck may be looked through three times.
