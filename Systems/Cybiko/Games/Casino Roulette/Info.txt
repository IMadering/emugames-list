A ball is made to circle in the rotating Roulette wheel until it comes to rest in a particular number with a particular color. There are 37 numbers and two colors. The player's goal is to predict the outcome of each spin by placing bets in the fields of the Roulette table. Each player bets against the bank. Player's winnings are based on how well he/she guesses the ball's final resting place on the wheel.
