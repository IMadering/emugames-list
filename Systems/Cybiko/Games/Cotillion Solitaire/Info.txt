This solitaire is played with two full decks (104 cards).
All fives and sixes are extracted from the deck and laid out on the board — they are base cards. Then, as the deck is looked through, other cards are played either on fives in descending order or on sixes in ascending order, according to their suits.
You win the game if you played all the cards so that stacks of fives (that is, started with fives) are ended with Kings, and stacks of sixes are ended with Queens.
The deck may be looked through two times.
