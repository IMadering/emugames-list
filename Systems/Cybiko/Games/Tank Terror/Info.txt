Of all the places to get stuck! You’re trapped inside a labyrinth with a bunch of enemy tanks. The only way out is to destroy all of them. This is made more difficult by the fact that there are a ton of objects inside this place that can destroy you and help your enemies: tents that hide enemy tanks, monoliths that you can’t destroy… And, to top it all off, you have a limited time to destroy the tanks, so make it snappy!

The object of the game is to destroy all enemy tanks as fast as possible on all 10 levels.
While moving in the labyrinth, your hero has to destroy all enemy tanks by blowing them up. Upon starting the game, you have five lives. You have to destroy each of the tanks on the level to go to the next level. Find bonuses that will help you to perform your mission.
