This interesting arcade game allows you to test your reaction and attention. Help Cy-B provide its family with food.

The goal is to score the most points by collecting apples and mushrooms. If four apples and mushrooms are dropped or allowed to fall, the game will end.

Fallen apples and mushrooms are cancelled if you gather 200, 500, or 1,000 points.
