Cybiko 4 PC (build 02.07.2005)

This software is not intended to be used to PLAY / RUN / USE, but to TEST Cybiko software with.
Only experienced Cybiko software developers should use this software.

This emulator is unoffical, which means Cybiko Inc. has nothing to do with it, don't ask them questions about it, they don't even know it exists :)

Also don't judge the Cybiko software from using this emulator.
The emulation is very unstable and does NOT represent the Cybiko device/games/apps in any way. Hence, many games/apps don't work, which isn't the case on a REAL Cybiko.

* Sound emulation is not implemented.
