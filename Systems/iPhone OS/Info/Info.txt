iPhone OS 2, released July 11, 2008, with the iPhone 3G, was optimized for a 412 MHz ARM11 processor and 128 MB RAM. Built on the XNU kernel, it introduced the App Store (July 10, 2008) with 500 apps, using Cocoa Touch and Objective-C, but lacked third-party multitasking. 

It supported 3G (HSDPA 3.6 Mbps), Wi-Fi (802.11b/g), and GPS, with Core Location API for apps. OpenGL ES 1.1 ensured smooth visuals, and power management optimized 3G/GPS usage.

iPhone OS 2 set the stage for iOS with apps and enterprise tools, despite performance limits.

iPhone OS 3, released on June 17, 2009, enhanced functionality and performance for iPhone, especially the iPhone 3GS with an ARM Cortex-A8 (600 MHz, up to 833 MHz) and 256 MB RAM.

iPhone 3GS introduced video recording (VGA, 30 fps, H.264), a 3 MP autofocus camera, Voice Control, and Bluetooth A2DP.

The system optimized the Mach kernel, reducing interface response time by 20-30% and power consumption. Compatible with iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, but some features were exclusive to 3GS.

iPhone OS 3 strengthened Apple's position, laying the groundwork for future iOS versions.
