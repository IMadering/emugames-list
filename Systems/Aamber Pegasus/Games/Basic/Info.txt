PEGASUS BASIC is a simplified form of BASIC (BASIC stands for Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code).
BASIC is arguably the best language for beginning microcomputer programmers. It's easy to learn, and programs can be developed quickly. For more experienced programmers, BASIC can form the basis of a system whose complexity can be expanded infinitely.

BASIC for the Aamber Pegasus computer is not just a programming language, but a part of the history of New Zealand's home computers. The Aamber Pegasus itself was the first computer designed and sold in New Zealand in 1981 by Technosys Research Labs.
