Monsters lurk within the night that is darker than darkness, within the darkness that is deeper than night….

They exist hidden inside a mansion. This mansion is called the “Mansion of Insmouse.”

However, even if you should beat the attacking monsters that come, you cannot escape so easily from the hand of the evil spirit of “Insmouse.”

Can you ever escape safely from the monsters of “Insmouse” and from this mansion of horror…!?

It’s all up to you, player!
