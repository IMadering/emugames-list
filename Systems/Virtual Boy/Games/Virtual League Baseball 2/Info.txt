Kemco planned to release a successor to Virtual League Baseball, or Virtual Professional Baseball ’95 as it was called in Japan, in March 1996, called simply Virtual League Baseball 2, or Virtual Professional Baseball ’96. But the game was ultimately cancelled due to the Virtual Boy being discontinued. A single screenshot of the Japanese version is known to exist, which has been printed in various Japanese magazines. The North American version, Virtual League Baseball 2, has received a “Kids to Adults” rating from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB). We can therefore assume that the game has been finished.

While the core gameplay has been much refined compared to the predecessor, major updates also have been made in terms of graphical appearance and the game making better usage of the Virtual Boy’s 3D capabilities.
