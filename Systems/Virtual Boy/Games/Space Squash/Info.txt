Space Squash for the Virtual Boy is a futuristic sports game that essentially plays like a 3D version of cosmic squash or tunnel ping-pong.

You control a robot named Peatron who is competing in a tournament against space pirates.

The main objective is to smash a spiked ball back and forth through a 3D corridor, aiming to get it past your opponent to score points, or hitting the opponent directly to deplete their energy bar.

Gameplay: You move around your half of the court and use the Virtual Boy's dual D-pads for movement and precise, angled shots. The ball ricochets off the arena walls.

Features: The game includes various power-ups (like speed boosts, shields, or homing shots) and features boss battles at the end of each area.

Visuals: It makes effective use of the Virtual Boy's signature red-and-black 3D effect, creating a strong sense of depth down the corridor.

It was a Japanese-exclusive title, well-regarded for its unique and engaging use of the console's 3D capabilities.
