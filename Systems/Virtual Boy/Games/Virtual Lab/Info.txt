Virtual Lab is a rare and late-release falling block puzzle game for the Virtual Boy (1995).

The gameplay involves connecting and sealing the open ends of tube-like pieces (resembling arteries or intestines) to clear them from the field. It is often criticized for its high difficulty, unpolished controls, and minimal use of the system's 3D capabilities. Due to its limited release, it is considered one of the most expensive collector's titles for the console.
