Mednafen is a portable, utilizing OpenGL and SDL, argument(command-line)-driven multi-system emulator. Mednafen has the ability to remap hotkey functions and virtual system inputs to a keyboard, a joystick, or both simultaneously. Save states are supported, as is real-time game rewinding. Screen snapshots may be taken, in the PNG file format, at the press of a button. Mednafen can record audiovisual movies in the QuickTime file format, with several different lossless codecs supported.

The following systems are supported(refer to the emulation module documentation for more details):
1. Apple II / II+ / IIe / Enhanced IIe
2. Atari Lynx
3. Neo Geo Pocket (Color)
4. WonderSwan
5. GameBoy (Color)
6. GameBoy Advance
7. Nintendo Entertainment System
8. Super Nintendo Entertainment System / Super Famicom
9. Virtual Boy
10. PC Engine / TurboGrafx 16 (CD)
11. SuperGrafx
12. PC-FX
13. Sega Game Gear
14. Sega Genesis / Megadrive
15. Sega Master System
16. Sega Saturn (64-bit only)
17. Sony PlayStation

Due to the threaded model of emulation used in Mednafen, and limitations of SDL, a joystick is preferred over a keyboard to play games, as the joystick will have slightly less latency, although the latency differences may not be perceptible to most people.

Cheats (Mednafen Emulator):
(Alt + T to enable/disable cheats, Alt + C open/close cheats console)
R A 1 L 0 05000300 09 Infinite Time (example)

This format is the internal syntax used by Mednafen for its .cht (cheat file) system and reflects the options available in the emulator's cheat console.

Here is the breakdown of each part of the code:
Mednafen Cheat Code Syntax Explained

R   Type of Operation (Replace)   R stands for Replace. This is the most common type of cheat. It instructs the emulator to continuously write (replace) a specific value into the game's RAM at the specified address.

A   Initial Status (Active)   A stands for Active. This sets the initial state of the cheat to Enabled when the game loads. If it were I (Inactive), it would be disabled by default.

1   Byte Length (1 Byte)   1 indicates the size of the data block to be written, which is 1 byte (8 bits). Since your value (09) is two hexadecimal digits, it fits perfectly into one byte (values from 00 to FF).

L   Endianness (Little Endian)   L stands for Little Endian. This specifies the byte order for multi-byte values. For a 1-byte cheat like this one, endianness is irrelevant, but the parameter is still required by the format.

0   Conditional ID (No Condition)   0 means there are No conditions attached to this cheat. This cheat is applied unconditionally and permanently. This field is used for referencing complex codes (like Master Codes).

05000300   RAM Address   This is the Hexadecimal Memory Address in the emulated system's RAM where the game stores the "Time" value.

09   Value to Write   This is the Hexadecimal Value that Mednafen will write to the address 05000300 every frame. The value 09 is likely a persistent high or static timer value, resulting in "Infinite Time".

Infinite Time   Cheat Name   This is the user-defined name or description for the cheat, making it easy to identify in the cheat list.
