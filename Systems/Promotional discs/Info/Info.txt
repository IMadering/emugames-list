In the early years of home computer ownership, magazines and newsletters might come bundled with a floppy disk to make it easier to load up programs discussed within their pages. These attached floppies (and cassettes as well) might have one or two programs on them.
After the dawn of CD-ROMs, packed-in CD-ROMs (and later DVD-ROMs) expanded out into lauded utilities and games, and also included drivers, demos, promotional material (including game trailers), and ultimately could be entire productions in themselves, providing menu-driven access to software with the magazine just referencing what was in the included CD-ROM. Pure CD-ROM and DVD-ROM magazines have also flourished to various degree.
This very large collection of cover disc images and files provides invaluable assistance to historical research, access to long-gone game and software company material, and early steps for genres of software that either took root or disappeared.
