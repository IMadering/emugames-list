PATTERN is a pattern generating program for use with the Sol computer or a computer with a VDM-1 Video Display Module. The patterns are generated in a kaleidoscopic format using a horizontal and a vertical value as the initial input data.

The pattern may be selected from a possible list of 256 different patterns. Each combination of vertical and horizontal values will produce a unique pattern. There is also an automatic pattern mode which generates a sequence of some of the more interesting patterns.
