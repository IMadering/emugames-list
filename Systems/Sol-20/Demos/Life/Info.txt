The game of LIFE was originally described in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazine, October, 1970, in an article by Martin Gardner. The game was originated by John Conway of Cambridge University, England.
The computerized version of LIFE can be found on many computer systems--in many cases with Teletype print routines. This version, using the Sol computer's video display capabilities or the VDM-1 Video Display Module with other computers, allows initial patterns to be composed directly on-screen and instant visualization of each generation as it is created. In addition, patterns may be stored and recalled from seven memory pattern registers. The generation
speed may be controlled from the console.
