Extended BASIC is a special adaptation of BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) for the SOL with a SOLOS
personality module or for other 8080-based computers with CUTER and the P.T. CUTS module. BASIC was selected for adaptation because it is simple and easy to learn while providing the powerful capabilities
of a high-level language. Thus, it is ideal for the user who is a
novice at using programming languages as well as for the advanced
user who wants to work with subroutines, functions, strings, and
machine-level interfaces.

Some of the outstanding features available in Extended BASIC are:
*Fully-formatted output to a variety of devices
*Many function subprograms, including mathematical, string, and video functions
*Program and data storage on cassette tape
*Full eight-digit precision
*User-defined functions on one or more lines
*Calculator mode for immediate answers
*Moving-cursor editing on video displays
*Complete capability for string handling
*Functions and statements for communicating with any number of
input/output channels
*Ability to view memory locations, change values, and branch to absolute addresses
*DATA files
*Matrix functions including INVert

Launch commands in the Solace emulator:
Load Program: ExtBasic.ent
Run with command: EX 0

Load and Run from Tape:
Type the XE command and start playing the tape.

ExtBasic.ent is the pristine original source. It has a bug where:
10 FOR I=1 TO 0
20 FOR K=1 TO 0
30 PRINT "impossible"
40 NEXT K
50 NEXT I
Will cause a CS (control stack) error. P.T. put out an errata sheet with a small patch to fix this bug. That has been applied and is in the file extbasic_patched.ent. This indeed fixes this problem. However, when running "ROMLN.BAS" (which uses a lot of NEXT 100 type statements and fiddles with the control index), we get a CS error with the patched version but not the original version.
