The Music System is an integrated package containing this manual, a circuit board kit, and a cassette containing the Music Program itself. The primary element of the system is the Music Program itself which performs the actual synthesis of notes being played.
All that is needed in addition to the Music System is: an 8080 based system with at least 4K of memory (8K or more, however, is recommended), SOLOS, CUTER or other compatible interface (a SOLOS/CUTER surrogate can easily be implemented), some I/O device (keyboard, display or other ASCII type terminal), an amplifier, stereo or other sound system including all interconnecting cables.

How to use the music system:
1. Choose the "music" item from the software list
2. Type XEQ press Enter
3. When the program starts, press R, you are back in the monitor
4. Type GET press Enter
5. When this finishes loading, type EX 0 press Enter, there's no response
6. Press F, wait for numbers to appear
7. Press S, wait for numbers to appear
8. Press P, music will be heard (it isn't very loud)
