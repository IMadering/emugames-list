A movable photon missile is aimed and fired in an attempt to stop unmanned runaway robot spaceships.
There are several types of spaceships containing dangerous cargoes of pesticides, DNA experiments, artificial flavorings, TV commercials and so on. They should be stopped before they reach a civilized area of the universe and endanger the populace.
Remote control of the missiles in flight is achieved by aiming the launching tube. The ships (and their contents) are generated by random logic and follow no pattern.
If two ships should collide, the flight log as well as the most dangerous cargo on board are jettisoned as a mass-seeking ion parachute which must be considered the most dangerous hazard of all.

Extra Time
The thousands digit in the score is used to determine whether "extra time" is to be initiated.
This value may be altered to any digit (1 - 9) by placing the ASCII value of the desired digit at location D02H in memory. For example, if 2000 is to be used as the minimum score to earn extra time, place 32Hex at location D02H in memory.
