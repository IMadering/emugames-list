In this version of QUBIC the playing surfaces are represented on the
video screen, and you are given an opportunity to select whether to play against another person or the computer. (CPU stands for the computer.)
As you or the computer make your move, it is recorded on the screen; the program will even place your marker in the position whose code you enter, and then give you an opportunity to change your move!
It IS possible to win a game of QUBIC against the computer.
Occasionally, the computer will cheat at the end of a close game by
changing one of your markers to its own. (It will never cheat in your
favor, of course.)
