Aquaplus P/ECE ("piece") emulator on SDL2.
This is my attempt to compile the emulator from the source code I got from here https://github.com/YonKuma/piemu
This source code is a fork from https://github.com/autch/piemu

This version does not work well. It has problems with sound and emulation of some games too fast.
You should try compiling other versions of the source code from the main branch and its forks.
