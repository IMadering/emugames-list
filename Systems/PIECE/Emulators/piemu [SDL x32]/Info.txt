Aquaplus P/ECE ("piece") emulator on SDL.
This version of the emulator works quite well with many P/ECE games and programs.

This version of the emulator was kindly provided by Mr^Burns on his Discord server https://discord.gg/gvU7ACyMRA
His YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/@MrBurnsObscureGamesTester

I couldn't find the source code for this particular version of the emulator.
