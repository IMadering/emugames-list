Moesyu (Version 1.01)

We aimed to create an exciting shooting game, not just a shooter.

Use the joystick to move and the A button to shoot.
The B button is for rapid shots.

This game is a shield system.
When you take damage, you lose 1 shield point.
If you take damage without a shield, the game is over.

When you take damage, your ship will lose hit detection for a short time.
In addition, your shield will recover by 1 point every time you pass a stage.
Now do your best to destroy the enemy's large ship.

After the 15th stage, the same stages will repeat.
