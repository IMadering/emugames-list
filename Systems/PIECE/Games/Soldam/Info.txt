Imitation Soldam

I made a game that is very similar to Soldam (Jaleco, 1992).

Introduction
As I wrote in my previous P/ECE research report, I like this game.
I want to play Soldam on the go! However, with Jaleco gone, there is little hope that Soldam will be ported to modern consoles.
So I made an imitation Soldam for P/ECE.

Rules
In simple terms, it is Tetris + Reversi.
Flip the tiles vertically, horizontally or diagonally, then erase them by making a horizontal row of the same color.
The erased row will move to the bottom row and become clear solvent.
Once you use Clear Soldam (mix it with Clear Soldam), it will disappear.
At the beginning of the game, you will be in two-color mode, so only two types of Soldam will appear.
As the game progresses, the mode changes to three-color, four-color, and so on, increasing the total number of types to four.
It can be a bit tricky to understand the direction in which to clamp the material and the presence of a transparent solder bridge.
Try searching for "Jaleco", "Soldam", "Rules", etc. in a search engine.

I tried to follow the rules of the original version as much as possible, but there are some changes in the falling speed,
The parts that I did not fully understand, such as the scoring system, have been adjusted accordingly.
In the future, once I know the rules of the original version, I would like to adapt it to them.
Also, in the original version, the more colors on the screen, the higher the probability of their appearance.
The characteristic is there, but since we did not know its distribution, we skipped it.
