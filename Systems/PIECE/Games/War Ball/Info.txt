War Ball

This game is very similar to Senkyu (developed by Save, 1995).

How to play
This is a game where you control falling colored balls and make rows of four or more balls to make them disappear.

As you progress through the levels, annoying balls will fall along with the colored balls.
No matter how many times you stack these annoying balls, they will not disappear.
Remove the colored balls that are next to the unwanted ball and return them to their original color.

When the colored balls accumulate at the top of the screen, the game ends.
