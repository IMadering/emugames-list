The number corresponds to the number of times the line crosses between the chips. Draw lines so that all the chips reach 0.

Rules
Draw lines that form a loop on a 6x6 grid.
Only one line can pass through a square. Lines cannot cross or connect (except to the starting point at the end).
The numbers on the grid are counters, which represent the total number of lines that cross numbers. Each time a line crosses a tile, the counters at both ends decrease by one. To beat the game, reset all counters to 0, return to the starting point, and close the loop.
