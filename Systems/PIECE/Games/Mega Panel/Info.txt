This game is very similar to Mega Panel (Namco, 1990).

How to play
Move the panels on the left screen to line up three or more panels of the same color vertically or horizontally.
If you line up three or more panels of the same color, the panels will disappear and a bomb will fall on the screen on the right.
Drop the bombs and destroy all the blocks to complete the round.

Eventually, the panel will rise from the bottom.
One mistake is if the panel goes beyond the top of the screen.
If you make three mistakes, the game is over.

Controls
Up, Down, Left, Right buttons: Move the panel.
A or B button: Raises the panel immediately.
