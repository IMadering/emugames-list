Lot Lot Simulation

This game is very similar to Lot Lot (c) Irem/Tokuma Shoten.

Use the two arrows to swap the ball and throw it to the highest scoring area.

One of the arrows will move according to your control.
The other arrow will follow a little later.
When you press the button, the balls in the room where the two arrows point will swap.

When the ball lands in the lower left room, a crab will jump out and cut the wire.
Hurry up and swap the balls to clear the lower left room.
If the crab cuts the wire, the game is over.
