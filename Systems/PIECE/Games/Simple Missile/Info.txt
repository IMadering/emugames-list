Simple Missile

This game is very similar to Missile Command.

Enemy missiles are targeting the city!
Defend your city by intercepting enemy missiles.
If the entire city is destroyed, the game is over.

Interceptor missiles are replenished after the round is cleared,
Destroyed cities will not return to their original state even if you pass the round.
