This game is very similar to the enjoyable chain puzzle game Trion Cube (Namco, 2006).
The rules of the game have been adjusted based on the free trial version.

How to play
This is a game where you control falling blocks and arrange them in a 3x3 shape to remove them.

If you arrange the blocks in a 3x3 shape, they will turn into Trion.
Continuously arranging them in a "3x3" shape, we continue the "chain".
As soon as the chain ends, the Trion will turn into coins and disappear behind the screen.

Each time a Trion is created, the player's spaceship will gain speed.
When the spaceship reaches the goal, the remaining time increases and it moves to the next "dimension".

The game ends when the blocks reach the top or when there is no time left.
As long as the chain continues, it's okay if you run out of time. Don't give up.

Left / Right buttons: Move the block left or right.
Down button: Makes the block fall quickly.
A / B buttons: Rotate the block.
