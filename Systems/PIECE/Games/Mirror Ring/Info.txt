Mirror Ring (version 1.09)

Mirror Ring is a very orthodox (and sloppy) RPG.
I would be flattered if you could play it casually.

Notes
You can stay at any inn in the world for free.

Field
In addition to the usual field encounters, you can also encounter living creatures called "Tabegoro".
They reproduce infinitely, so please hunt them down.
After the battle, you can get Tabegoro (recovery medicine), so eat it while you're in the early stages.
I think it's relatively easy to progress if you go adventuring.

Escape
You can always escape from small enemies, so it's fun in an emergency.
