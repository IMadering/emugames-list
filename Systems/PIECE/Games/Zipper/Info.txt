You are a small arrow at the bottom of the screen.
For some reason, a wall will be coming towards you, so use the left and right keys (or AB buttons) to avoid it.

Hold the left key (B button) to move left.
Hold the right key (A button) to move right.
As long as you don't press anything, you move forward.

Depending on how far you move, you will get points.

As time goes on, the energy in the gauge decreases,
Collect the chips with the inscription "F" that appear from time to time to restore.

The game ends if you hit a wall or run out of energy.
