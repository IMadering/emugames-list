Spout (Version 1.1)

This is a pixel game in the style of Moon Landing.

How to play
Move your ship up without hitting the wall.
When you press the button, something is thrown out, allowing you to destroy walls or move using recoil.
When you reach a checkpoint (line), your time will be added, and the remaining time will be added as a bonus.
