Qulipp is a purely thinking puzzle game running on the P/ECE platform.
Control the main character, a frog named Clip, and collect all the flowers that bloom on the screen.

There are six types of terrain:
Water surface: Clip cannot be moved. Leaves can be moved.
Ground: Clip can be moved. Leaves cannot be moved.
Water plants: Neither clips nor leaves can be moved.
Leaves...Clip can be moved. Leaves cannot be moved. Use A + direction to move.
Leaf eaten by insects...Neither clip nor leaf can be moved. Use A + direction to move.
Flowers...are the same as the ground. Once you pass through it, it becomes just ground.
