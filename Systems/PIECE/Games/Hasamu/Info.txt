This game is very similar to Hasamu (Irem, 1991).

How to play

・Select two tiles of the same type.
・You can only move one of the two selected tiles in one direction only.
・The selected tile and the tile between them will disappear.
・When all the tiles are removed, the game is cleared.
The real Hashamu is a game where you go through stages, but this imitation of Hashamu is designed to be cleared in one stage.

The game is similar to Shanghai and Sichuan Province, but Hasamu offers more freedom in how you take the pieces, making the game easier and more interesting.
