This game is very similar to Soroban Gu.

Rules
Move the blocks and line them up in rows of three or more to remove them.
You can also add another block to the block before it disappears.

At regular intervals, a "spawn marker" will appear, as well as new blocks.
At this time, if there is a block in the place of the "spawn marker", it will be an error.
When the error indicator in the upper left corner of the screen reaches 0, the game ends.

If you connect four or more blocks to erase them, the number of errors will decrease by one.

The difference between the A and B buttons is whether the cursor moves with the block or not.
If you press the A button, the cursor will not move, but if you press the B button, the cursor will move.

*The control using the A button is the same as the real Soroban Gu "Type B".
The operation using the B button is somewhat unique. (I think it's easier to use, what do you think?)
