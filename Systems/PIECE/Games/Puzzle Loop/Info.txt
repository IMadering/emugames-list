This game is very similar to Puzzle Loop (Mitchell, 1998).

How to Play
・Shoot the gems to match three or more of the same color to remove them.
・If there are gems of the same color in front of or behind the gem that disappears, they will be attracted to each other and cause a chain reaction.
・When a gem reaches the deadline, the game ends.

Left and Right buttons: Rotate the tower.
A or B button: Launches the gems.
START button: Pause/resume the game.
