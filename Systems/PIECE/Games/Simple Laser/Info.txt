Simple Laser

This game is very similar to "Spacewar" (Rejac, 1979).
It is better known by its nickname "Chameleon Army" than by its real name.

Incidentally, Rejac is what later became Konami Industries.
At the time, I played this game without really thinking about the manufacturer, but I guess it can also be considered one of the good old Konami games.
