This game is very similar to Hopping Mappy (Namco, 1986).

How to play
Control Mappy and capture the target.
If you capture the same type of target in succession, your score multiplier will increase. If possible, it is beneficial to capture targets of the same type in succession.

If Mappy touches Nyamco or Myukies, he is eliminated.
When Nyamco gets tired and stops standing, you can step on him to knock him down.

After a certain amount of time has passed from the start of the round, enemies will start moving faster.
After a certain amount of time, your ancestors will appear.
Be careful not to waste too much time on completing the round.

Controls
Up, Down, Left, Right buttons: Control Mappy.
