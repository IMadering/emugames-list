Imitation Baratan

This game is very similar to the game "Baratan" that appears in the TV program "English Talk Night" (NHK General TV, 2005).

Select panels with English letters to complete an English word.
They compete to see who can correctly pronounce the most English words before the 60-second timer at the top of the screen runs out.

For example, if the correct English word is "RED", then "R" will be selected. The panel contains the remaining two letters: "E" and "D", and an additional letter: "Z".
Select a panel, and when only one remains, press the A button again to determine if you have selected it correctly.
You can also press the B button at any time to go back one move.
