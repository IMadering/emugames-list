This is the most basic SameGame.
Move the cursor up, down, left and right on the panel and use the A button to erase the balls.
Balls cannot be erased unless two or more are connected.
Pressing the B button will display the number of connected balls.

The game ends when there are no more balls connected together or when all the balls are removed.
