I tried to revive a small part of the game "Snake", which disappeared with Semigra. The most remarkable thing about this snake is that it can not only stretch, but also explode.

Control the ever-growing snake so that it does not collide with the body (■), the outer wall, or the mines (□).
Gas comes out of the snake's body, and when the gas fills the body or the space enclosed by the walls, an explosion occurs.
Any area adjacent to the explosion will be destroyed, and points will be awarded according to the number of mines that fall into the explosion zone. You can get a high score by trapping several mines at once.
