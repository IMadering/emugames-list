The essence of the game is to destroy enemies until the time on the bar below runs out.
Enemies will appear one after another as you defeat everyone on the screen, so destroy them as quickly as possible to get more points.
When you defeat an enemy, "P" marks will appear. If you collect 10 of them, you will become stronger.

There are six levels of power-ups.
You can get more points by capturing "P" marks in a row without letting them disappear off the screen.
The initial score is 100 points, but it can be increased to a maximum of 1600 points.
(Format: 100 → 200 → 400 → 800 → 1600).
If you remove one of them from the screen, your score will decrease by one level.
There are two hidden bonuses. Find the conditions to achieve a high score.
If you come into contact with an enemy bullet or the enemy itself, the timer will decrease a little.
Try to avoid being hit as much as possible.
The game ends when the timer at the bottom runs out.
At the end, you will get a bonus score of 200 points multiplied by the number of "P"s you got.

Your game data is stored in "nim2.dat" and your best score in "nim2_hi.dat".
Deleting this file will delete your records and game data.
