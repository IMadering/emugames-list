Unheeded Die

This is a two-player (human vs. computer) Sugoroku+ battle simulator game.

Each character has their own personality, health, and skills.

The battle begins with a roll of dice that determines the starting point.

Roll - Roll the dice. Then the turn ends at that total.
Item - Use an item (not implemented in this version).

Attack - This performs an attack. You must be behind the opponent to be able to do this, and each turn consumes a different amount of PP. The stock is also different.
Save - End your turn without rolling dice. Instead, you will accumulate PP.

About the field
Black floors can cause damage.
"Floating beads will restore health."
Things like crystals increase PP.
Box-like items will give you items.

The victory condition is to reduce the opponent's HP to 0 or below. Or you can beat your opponent and increase the difference by 16 points or more. He disappears behind the screen.
