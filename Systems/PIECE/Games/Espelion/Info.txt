The original inspiration for this game was Espgaluda (CAVE, 2003), a shooter game with an addictive scoring system.

When you defeat an enemy, a gem will appear.
Gems provide energy for awakening.

Press the B button to awaken it, and the enemy bullets will become slower.
If you defeat an enemy while in an awakened state, the bullets fired by the defeated enemy will turn into gold nuggets.
If you collect gold nuggets in succession, you will get a high score.

When awakening, your gem supply will decrease.
If you run out of gems while awakening, the enemy bullets will become faster.

Controls:
Up, Down, Left, Right buttons: Move the player.
B button - Awakens or cancels awakening.
A button - Fires a shot.
