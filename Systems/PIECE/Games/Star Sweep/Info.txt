This game is very similar to Star Sweep (Namco/Axela, 1997).

How to play
Use the arrow keys to move the cursor, the spin key to select a direction, and the confirm key to throw a block.
You can throw a block anywhere on the screen as long as there is an empty space. To remove blocks, connect star blocks of the same color.
To remove an interfering cloud, remove the block next to it.

The boss has durability, and each time you remove a block next to it, you lose one life (a heart mark).
To defeat the boss, remove blocks next to it as many times as the number of hearts appears.

New blocks will rise from the bottom of the screen at regular intervals.
Also, when the cursor is at the bottom of the screen, press and hold the down arrow key, this will allow the next block to appear quickly.

When a block reaches the top of the screen, a countdown begins.
Please clear the blocks before the count reaches 0.
If you do not clear the blocks in time and the count reaches zero, the game will end.

As you clear blocks in a chain reaction, the stock (star) displayed in the upper right corner of the screen will increase. If you collect eight stocks, you will receive bonus points.

Stocks also slow down the countdown.
When a block reaches the top of the screen, if you have stocks, they will be depleted before the countdown begins.
When all stocks are depleted, the countdown will begin.

Up, Down, Left, Right buttons: Move the cursor.
If you press further, the next block will immediately appear at the very bottom of the screen.
B button: Rotates the cursor.
A button: Place a block at the cursor position.
