This game is very similar to Gunpey (c) Bandai.

How to Play

Swap the panels on the field,
Connect the lines on the panel with one move from left to right on the screen.
When the lines are connected, the panel disappears.
You can erase several elements at once by branching the lines or adding panels.
When a certain number of panels are erased, the stage will be cleared.

The line rises at regular intervals.
You can also immediately pull out the next line by pressing the B button, without waiting for a certain time.
If the panel goes beyond the top edge of the screen, the game is over.
