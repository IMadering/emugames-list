Grab enemies with the anchor and destroy them by throwing or rubbing against other enemies. Throwing the anchor and hitting them with it is more effective than rubbing.
The anchor cannot grab large enemies with rings around them. Damage them and remove the rings before grabbing them.
When you destroy a large enemy, the bullets on the screen turn into "bananas" and you get "banana money".

When you are hit by an enemy or a bullet, the damage accumulates, and if it exceeds a certain amount, the game ends. The damage slowly regenerates over time.

Controls
Up, Down, Left, Right Buttons: Control the charaster/anchor.
Pressing the A Button: Shoot/pull the anchor.
Releasing the A Button: Throw.
Pressing the B button: Lock the ship/control the anchor. (This is a sub-operation, so you can play without using it.)
SELECT button: Return to the main screen.
