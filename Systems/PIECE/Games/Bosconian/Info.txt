Control your ship and destroy the enemy base.
As the round progresses, Myship's beam will become slightly more powerful.

To destroy the enemy base, you can either destroy its core (the center part) directly, or destroy all six surrounding artillery towers.
As the rounds progress, enemy bases will begin to defend their positions and launch missiles from their positions.

Be sure to shoot down the reconnaissance planes that appear from time to time.
If the recon plane misses, an all-out attack of enemy missiles will begin!
