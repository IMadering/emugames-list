★ History ★
Once upon a time, far, far away, there was a small island.
On the island lived many different kinds of animals, but they did not get along with each other, and there were constant fights every day.
One day, unable to bear this sight any longer, God said:
"You associate with the same people, so you have disagreements with others. Take a break for a while."
The animals began to move around the small island.
Will there ever be true peace on this small island shrouded in tension?

★ Rules ★
The goal is to rearrange the animals so that animals of the same species are not next to each other.
There are three types of animals on the screen. Among them, there are three animals located next to each other in a triangle, which can be swapped by rotating them to the right or left.
By moving the animals in this way, you can complete the game, making sure that animals of the same species are not next to each other.
