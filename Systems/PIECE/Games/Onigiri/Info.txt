This is a rice ball rolling game.

The rules are simple. All you have to do is control the rice ball as it rolls down, avoiding any snakes, spiders or webs.
Going down one level earns you 1 point, and picking up a pickled plum earns you 5 points.

Use the A button during the game.
The rice ball keeps rolling, so press the button to change direction.
The left and right sides of the screen are connected.
