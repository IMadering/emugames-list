Simple Ataxx

For those of you who are not familiar with Ataxx, here is a brief explanation.
Ataxx is an arcade game released by Capcom about 10 years ago.
At first glance, it looks like a game of Reversi, but the rules are slightly different.

The conditions for moving a piece are as follows:
Eight squares adjacent to your piece. In this case, the frame in its original position will not disappear. That is, it splits.
16 squares adjacent to your piece. At this time, the piece in its original position will disappear. This is a normal move.
And if there are enemy pieces next to the destination position, they will be flipped.
When all the enemy pieces are destroyed or there is no free space left on the field, the player with the most pieces wins.

Simple Ataxx was created as a teaching material for the P/ECE Simple library.

The working method is as follows:
Select the piece you want to move and press the A button to confirm.
Select the destination and press the A button to confirm.
Pressing B in step 1 will skip that move.
If you press B in step 2, you can go back to step 1 and re-select the original piece.
The current program is very weak, as it only looks one move ahead.

If you are interested in the Ataxx series of games, we highly recommend you try the original Ataxx!
The slightly weird graphics and sound will hook you.
