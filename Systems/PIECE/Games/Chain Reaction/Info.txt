Chain Reaction

This is the P/ECE version of the classic computer board game Chain Reaction.

How to play

- Choose a square and place your piece on it.
- You cannot place a piece on a square that already has a piece of a different color.
- If you place a piece on a square that already has a piece of the same color, the piece will become larger.
- In the squares at the four corners, if a piece becomes two sizes larger, it will split.
- In the squares near the wall, if a piece becomes three times larger, it will split.
- In any other square, if a piece becomes four times larger, it will split.
- If an opponent's piece is on the square where a piece is split, it becomes your piece.
- You win if you remove all of your opponent's pieces from the board.
