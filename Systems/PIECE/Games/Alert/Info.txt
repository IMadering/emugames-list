ALERT is a shooter with boss generation.
However, the boss is generated automatically.
It does not use any complex algorithms, but it is quite good.
It is touching, so I hope you will just accept it as it is and play the game with this in mind.

Make full use of 3WAY and laser (?) shots to defeat bosses.
If your ship comes into contact with enemy bullets or the enemy itself, you will die.
When you destroy a boss or an option, the bullets on the screen turn into bonus items. Catch as many fish as possible to earn points.

Explanation of the menu:
EASY GAME: Only 6 levels. Quite an easy mode.
HARD GAME: Only 12 levels. A mode that gets more and more difficult.
ENDLESS: Mode that never ends.
