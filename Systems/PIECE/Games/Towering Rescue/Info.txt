Towering Rescue Simulation

This game is very similar to Towering Rescue (Gakken, 1981).

Control a helicopter and rescue people from the roof of a damaged building.
After the rescue, evacuate them to the building on the right.

If the rescue operation is delayed, the building will collapse or start a fire and the game will be over.
If you miscontrol the helicopter and it crashes into the building, the game is over.
