"Help me..." the girl's voice comes from inside the castle.
This is a 10-level puzzle game where you have to save her from the castle.

How to Play
Use the [arrow keys] to move the cursor and click on the block or the boy with the [A button].
You can move up, down, left and right with the [directional keys] and spacebar.

Pressing the [A] button (or the [B] button) again will return it to the cursor state.

If you move the boy to the target indicated by the arrow (↑), you will clear that floor.
If you repeat this process, you must reach the back of the castle before time runs out. Please save this girl.

Note! !
Black blocks (and keyhole blocks), items and enemies cannot be moved.

Items (keys, watches, swords) can be crushed by blocks.
Unfortunately, enemies cannot be crushed by blocks.

Items
You can move the boy and pick up items from the floor.
You can only have one item.
Please note that if you pick up another item, the previous item will disappear.

Key: You can open the keyhole block (only works once).

Clock: While you hold it, the time limit decreases more slowly.

Sword: You can crash into the enemy and defeat him (this only works once).

Items can be carried to the next floor.
There are also some moments where you can complete the level more efficiently by taking items with you that you think you might need on the next floor.

GAME OVER
・Time limit disappeared (became 0).
・Boy attacked the enemy without a weapon (sword).
