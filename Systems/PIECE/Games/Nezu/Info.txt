In this world, earthquakes are common, so warehouses and other buildings are made up of many columns. The densely packed columns make it difficult to manage the warehouse. The damage to food supplies, especially by rats and other pests, is immeasurable. They tried to destroy the rats with a warehouse crawler robot developed by a Japanese appliance manufacturer, but it was not very successful. Each company develops a new type of destroyer.
