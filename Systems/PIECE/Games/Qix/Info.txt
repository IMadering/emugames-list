Imitation Qix

This game is very similar to Qix (c) TAITO.

How to play
Draw a line around the board and fill it.
If you fill more than the specified percentage in each round, the round is lost.
If an enemy touches the line while you are drawing it, you will have to redraw it. Doing so will reduce the remaining time by 10 seconds.
When the time runs out, the game ends.
(Real Qix is ​​based on remaining lives, but fake QIX is based on time.)

During the game
Without pressing the A or B buttons: Use the up, down, left, and right buttons to move around the frame.
While holding down the A or B button: Use the up, down, left, and right buttons to move around the board and draw lines.
If you release the A or B button while drawing a line: You will quickly retrace your steps along the line.
