Flipull Simulation

This game is very similar to Flipull (Taito, 1989).

How to play
- Throw existing blocks and hit them with blocks of the same design to erase them.
- If a block collides with a block of a different design after erasing, it is replaced and becomes a new block.
- When the number of remaining blocks becomes less than the required level, the level is completed.
- When there are no more blocks to erase, a special block is used.
- When there are no more special blocks, the game ends.
