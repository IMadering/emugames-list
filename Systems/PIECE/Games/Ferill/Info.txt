"FERILL" was released in 1989 by the Doujin SSG community software developers for PC-8801SR and later.
It is an action puzzle game.
This time, we thought it would be a shame to lose such a quality game, so we decided to port it to P/ECE.

Use the help of the wizard Ferill to return the crystal ball to its pedestal.

During the game, you can move Ferill by pressing a direction, create or remove the magic wall on the right with A and on the left with B.
Also, SELECT will cause self-destruction.

Saving occurs automatically every 5 levels.

- Rules -
The stage will be cleared when you carry the crystal ball to the top of the pedestal.
If there are multiple pedestals, you can use any of them.

The crystal ball rolls on its own and changes direction when it hits the wall.
At this time, POWER will decrease by 1 point, and if POWER reaches 0, it will be a miss.

If the crystal ball is dropped from a height of more than two steps, it will break, and this will be a mistake.

If you make five mistakes, the game is over.

There are three types of walls: normal walls, moving walls, and magic walls.

If you move a movable wall one space, it will become a normal wall.
Also, if you click from below when there is a crystal ball on top, the crystal ball will also move up one frame.

"Magic walls cannot be built where there are rubies.

The crystal ball also rolls above Ferill's head.
Ferill cannot move when there is a crystal ball above his head.

Ferill manages to stop the rolling crystal ball.
During this time (when you are near the crystal ball), you will no longer be able to create or remove magical walls.

*Level 54 may be unsolvable!
