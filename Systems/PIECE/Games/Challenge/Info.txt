Challenge 1/64

Continuing with the previous game "Shining Lucky Star!", this is another game where you can test your luck.
This time, I tried to make it simpler.
I hope you can feel at least a little bit of the excitement of a game where mistakes are unacceptable.

I made a game based on a project that aired on an entertainment show a while back.
I still remember how fun it was, even though the rules were simple.
