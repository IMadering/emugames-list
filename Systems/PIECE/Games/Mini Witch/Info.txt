Ojou-sama Mini Witch

This is a game where you simply move forward, avoiding obstacles and collecting power-ups.

1. The scrolling speed becomes infinitely faster as you progress.
2. There are two types of obstacles: missiles and floating mines.
Missiles fly in a straight line, while floating mines move up and down. The power-up does not move. It moves at the same speed as the scrolling.
3. If you fall too low, you will take damage and be thrown back. It will also bounce up, but it will not do any damage, so use it wisely.
4. For every 10,000 points you collect, you will recover 10 lives.
5. If you keep getting the same power-up, it will become a combo and your bonus points will double.
Any combo of 8 or more points is worth 10,000 points (meaning a guaranteed life increase).
6. When certain conditions are met, you will enter a 15-second bonus stage. During the bonus stage, your speed does not change and no obstacles appear.
7. The playable characters, Serika and Ayaka, have slightly different abilities. Serika has inertia and a slow top speed, while Ayaka has a fast top speed and quick reactions.
