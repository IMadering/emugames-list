Mini Driller

This game is similar to the "Driller Mode" of Mr. Driller (Namco, 1999).

How to play
Control the player to dig deeper and deeper into the underground blocks.
If the player is crushed by a falling block, the game will end.

The "AIR" bar on the right side of the screen shows the remaining amount of air (oxygen).
The air supply decreases over time, and when it reaches zero, the game will end.
Picking up the air capsule will restore 20% of your air supply.

You cannot destroy blocks marked with an "X" until you have dug them up five times.
Be careful, if you destroy a block marked with an "X", your air supply will decrease by 20%.
