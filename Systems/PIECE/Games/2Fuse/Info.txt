2Fuse

This game is very similar to 2Fuse (Mojo Forest, 2012).

How to play
- Select two panels with the same color and number to erase them.
- If you select two "1" panels, they will become one "2" panel.
- If you select two "2" panels, they will become one "star" panel.
- If you select two "star" panels, a special effect will be activated for a certain period of time.
- The white star's special effect is to increase the speed at which panels appear on the field.
- The black star's special effect is to increase the score multiplier.
- The gray star's special effect is to make time flow more slowly.
- When time runs out, the game ends.
