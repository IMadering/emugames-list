Palamedes Imitation

This game is very similar to Palamedes (Taito/Hotbee, 1990).

How to Play

This is a game where the player controls dice falling from the screen to destroy them.

Use the left and right buttons to move the player, the B button to change the number on the dice, and the A button to shoot.
If you hit a dice with the same number, that dice will disappear and fall into the dice area at the bottom of the screen.
When the dice at the bottom of the screen have a winning combination, press the down button.
You can erase dice at a time according to the number of lines that match your role.

When the dice fall from the screen and reach the player's position, the game is over.

This game is a vertical screen game. Hold P/ECE rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
