Simple Centipede
This game is similar to Centipede (Atari, 1980).

Control the player to shoot down the centipede.
When you shoot the centipede, the part you hit turns into a mushroom and the centipede splits.
When the player and the centipede touch, that's one mistake.
Three mistakes means game over.

In the real Centipede, there are various enemies besides centipedes, such as spiders and scorpions, but in this Simple Centipede, there are only centipedes.
Just keep defeating centipedes.
