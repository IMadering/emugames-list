Defeat all enemies and clear the level.
If you get hit by a bullet, you die.
If you lose a life, your time will increase by 10 seconds.
When you run out of lives, the game is over.
Also, if you fail to clear the level within 30 seconds, the enemies will become stronger.

Your ship can move in four directions.
If you continue moving in the same direction, you will speed up.
You can turn 90 degrees without losing speed.
Switching in the opposite direction will stop the engine.
Also, if it hits an enemy, it will be thrown back and lose speed.
The power of your ship's shots changes depending on how fast you are moving.
The faster you are, the more power you have and the further your projectile will fly.
