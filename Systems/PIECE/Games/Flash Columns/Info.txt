Flash Columns Simulation

This game is very similar to the Flash Columns mode from Columns II (Sega, 1990).

Line up three or more identical gems in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally to remove them.
When you remove all the flashing gems, the stage will be cleared.

A flashing gem will appear on the skull sign at regular intervals.
When you clear the flashing gems from the skull sign, the bottom of the board will rise and become narrower.
Be careful not to erase the flashing gems on the skull sign.
(You can complete the level even if there are still flashing gems in the skull mark.)

When the gems reach the top, the game is over.
