This is a variation of tennis that has been around since ancient times.

Chances are that everyone has played this game at least once. In simple terms, it is a very simple game where you hit a flying "rope-like object" with a racket and if it lands in your opponent's territory, you get a point, but if you fail to hit it, your opponent gets a point. It is a straightforward and classic game.

About Gravity
If you turn on gravity, gravity will be applied every 10 bounces. Use the movement of the stars in the background to determine which way gravity is applied. After a certain amount of time, everything will return to normal.
