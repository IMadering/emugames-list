Simple Fruit Smash

This game is very similar to Fruit Smash (Electrotank, 2006).

How to play

Swap adjacent fruits to form three or more in a row vertically or horizontally to clear them.

If you swap fruits without making three or more in a row, they will return to their original position before you swapped them.

The fruit that you erase will turn into juice and fill the juice meter on the right side of the screen.
Fill the juice meter before the timer reaches zero.
When the juice meter is full, your level will increase and the timer will reset.

When the timer reaches 0, the game ends.
