Aruru's Operation Hive Minigame

Control Aruru to scare away the bees.
Use the A button to perform a torch smoke attack and the B button to jump.
If you fall from a jump, you can crush the bee with your foot.

When you take damage, you lose one life point.
If you lose all your lives, the game is over.
When you take damage, you become invincible for a short time.

As you accumulate points, the number of bees flying at the same time will increase.
In fact, since the bees are endlessly spawning, it may be impossible to remove the hive.
Poor Aruru...
