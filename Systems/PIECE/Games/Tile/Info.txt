This is a game where you shoot down or run away from mysterious tiles (enemies) falling from the sky.
If the player is hit by an enemy or an enemy bullet, the game will be over and the player will be destroyed.

Left and Right buttons: Move the player.
A button: Fires a shot.
B button: Rapidly fires.
SELECT button: Returns to the title screen.

This is a fixed screen shooter game made using D and SDL.
The levels quickly increase and become quite difficult in a short period of time, allowing you to enjoy a quick score.
It is fun to shoot the red enemies that rush at you at high speed and decide whether to destroy the blue enemies or let them pass.
The characteristics of the red enemy that stays on the ground and chases the player are reminiscent of a bomber with balloons.
The feeling of the blue enemy returning fire reminded me of Halley's Comet.
