P/ECE Minigame "Rorosuke's Close Call"

Game Rules
Only Roro's face is sticking out of the barrel.
There are 12 holes in the barrel for the knife.
Insert the knife first.
Be careful, as the first hit will result in the game over.
Insert the required number of knives into the barrel, and if they do not pierce Roro, the level will be completed.
If the knife hit is dangerous, Roro's facial expression will change.
The facial expressions of the figures follow a certain pattern, so be careful not to pierce Roro.

You can get an item for completing the level: Food; Bones; Iron; Treasure.

In P/ECE, it is impossible to determine the exact item.
You will know once you transfer the item to the PC.
