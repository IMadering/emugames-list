A side-scrolling game where you have to avoid obstacles.

How to play
The line on the left side of the screen is your plane. It only requires two buttons to control: A and B.
Your ship will rise as long as you hold the A button, and will fall when you release it.
As long as you hold the B button, your ship will move forward in a straight line.
Use these two controls to avoid approaching ceilings, floors, and obstacles.
Points will be awarded when moving forward, but points will be deducted when moving straight forward with the B button.
If you hit a ceiling, floor, or obstacle, the game will be over.

Bonus
At the title screen, press the Up button and then the B button to start from LEVEL 11.
Alternatively, if you press the Down button and then the B button at the title screen, you will start from LEVEL 21.
If either command is successful, the message "Start from LV.11 (or 21)" will appear in the upper left corner of the title screen.
