Interground (Version 1.1)

This is an avalanche-style adventure game where you bury your victim.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys to control the joystick and send sand flying to bury your enemies. At this point, if you fill in multiple boxes at once, you'll get a high score.
If the stick hits an enemy that's still moving before it's completely buried, it's game over. Think of the bump in the center of the stick as a guide to tell if it's been hit.
If you clear all the enemies within the time limit, you'll get bonus points equal to (time remaining * number of stages) and move on to the next stage. If the time runs out, it's game over.
