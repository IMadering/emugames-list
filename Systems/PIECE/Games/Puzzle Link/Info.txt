Connect the interconnected puzzles! This game is very similar to Puzzle Link (Yumekobo, 1999).

How to Play
Connect the distant targets (*1) with the parts (*2) to erase them.
When a certain number of targets are destroyed in each round, a clear target will appear.
When you connect and erase clear targets, the round is cleared.
When the target reaches the bottom of the screen, the game ends.

(*1) "Target" refers to the block falling from the top of the screen.
(*2) "Parts" are the blocks that the player shoots.

Left / Right buttons: Move the player left / right.
Down button: Makes the target descend faster.
A button: Shoots parts.
The color of the part will be the same as the target that the part first shot.
B button: Erases parts.

Afterword
This is a game with rules that are quite difficult to explain.
You probably can't imagine what kind of game this is just by reading the rules described above.
The rules are actually not that complicated; it's like a "Samegame" where you forcefully connect and erase pieces.
You will naturally learn the rules after playing a few times, so please try it.
