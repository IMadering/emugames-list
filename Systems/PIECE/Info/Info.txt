In November 2001, Aquaplus produced P/ECE (pronounced piece), a mobile gaming platform that allows user to download games via USB or infrared port.
Games could be downloaded for free on their website and commercial games could also be purchased.
The device quickly gain a cult following among the developer’s community of all background.
On August 20, 2004, Aquaplus archived the P/ECE to their main website. While Aquaplus stop supporting the device, the community never stopped developing for it, with new commercial games still being made as far as 2021.

Nick's P/ECE Collection - https://archive.org/details/piece_202204
My personal collection of P/ECE software, compiled from various sources. Contains games, applications, source code, software updates, etc. There's quite a lot of stuff in here, although it's by no means an exhaustive collection of everything released for the P/ECE. Many games are still missing.
