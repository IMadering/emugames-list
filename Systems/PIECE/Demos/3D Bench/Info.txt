3D Bench Simulation

3D BENCHMARK VGA is a benchmark program similar to 3D Bench (New Dimension International, 1990).

Drag "p3dbench.pex" into P/ECE and run it.
After the title is displayed, a 3D demo is played for about 10 seconds and the average frame rate is measured.
After that, the same 3D demo will continue to play in a loop, so press the SELECT button to end it.

This is 3D Bench, a nostalgic DOS benchmark program.
It was mainly used to measure the speed of DOS rendering by a video card.
