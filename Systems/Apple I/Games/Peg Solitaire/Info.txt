Also known as "Peg Game" or "Hi-Q".

Start by removing one "peg" (pegs are represented by letters) to leave an empty spot. Hop a peg over an adjacent peg and onto the empty spot beyond it to remove the hopped-over peg. Repeat until no more moves can be made.

The fewer pegs left, the better! Can you leave only one?
