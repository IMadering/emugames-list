The game of Hi-Lo is a simple guessing game in which the player tries to guess a number chosen by the computer. The name "Hi-Lo" stands for "Higher-Lower", which reflects the principle of the game: after each guess, the computer gives a hint as to whether the number is higher or lower than the one the player named.

Released back in 1976 by Wendell Sander. Written in BASIC programming language.
