In the article A Number Game for the 6502 this game was published in Dr. Dobb's Journal of Computer Calisthenics & Orthodontia by Steve Wozniak in 1976. It included specific instructions to run the game on the Apple-1 and comes with the assembly source listing.

Instructions
MASTERMIND is a number guessing game. In this version the computer generates a 5-digit, random number where the digits are limited to 0 through 7. The user attempts to guess the number in the fewest possible tries. After each guess the computer informs the user as to how many digits were correct (contained in the random number) and in the correct position by printing + signs, and how many digits are correct but in the wrong position - signs. The user is not informed as to exactly which digit positions the + and the - signs correspond. A skilled player can usually win in 6 or 7 tries.

1. Computer plays READY?
2. User hits any key when ready (not echoed). A random number is generated by counting from the READY? message to key depression.
3. Computer prints 01 for move number.
4. User enters his 5-digit guess following the move number. Remember that valid digits are 0 through 7 only. Entering any invalid character cancels the line and the computer repeats step 3 for the current move. This may be used to cancel errors.
5. Immediately after entering the 5th digit of his guess, the computer will print a number of + signs (for correct digits in correct positions) followed by a number of - signs (for correct digits in incorrect positions). This score is indicated to the right of the guess and does not indicate the specific digit positions involved. Play resumes at 3 for the next move number except for a win.
