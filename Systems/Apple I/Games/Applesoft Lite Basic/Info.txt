Applesoft BASIC Lite is a reduced version of Applesoft BASIC specifically designed for the Apple I computer. According to a2central.com, this version omits features like high-resolution graphics and cassette I/O, which were not available on the original Apple I hardware. It was created as a port by Tom "Cowgod" Greene and discussed on Vince Briel's Replica 1 support site.
The primary reason for this "lite" version is that the original Apple I didn't support the full range of features found in Applesoft BASIC for the Apple II.
