Hamurabi is a text-based strategy video game of land and resource management. It was first developed under the name King of Sumeria or The Sumer Game by Doug Dyment in 1968 at Digital Equipment Corporation as a computer game for fellow employee Richard Merrill's newly invented FOCAL programming language.

Instructions
Several resources have to be managed in this game: people, acres of land and bushels of grain. The computer asks questions and the player has to answer them with a number.
In this game you direct the administrator of Sumeria, Hamurabi, how to manage the city. The city initially has 1000 acres, 100 people and 3000 bushels of grain in storage.

You may buy and sell land with your neighboring city-states for bushels of grain, the price will vary between 17 and 26 bushels per acre. You also must use grain to feed your people and as seed to plant the next year's crop.

You will quickly find that a certain number of people can only tend a certain amount of land and that people starve if they are-not fed enough. You also have the unexpected to contend with such as a plague, rats destroying stored grain, and variable harvests.

You will also find that managing just the few resources in this game is not a trivial job over a period of say ten years. The crisis of population density rears its head very rapidly.

Winning Strategy
Spoiler alert! Efforts of Jeff Quast found a winning strategy for this game:

The winning strategy is to systematically starve 3% of the population each turn, to wish for plagues, and to leave as little food as possible available to be eaten by rats by buying land with any excess grain (and selling land to make up for any deficiencies).

With this strategy you can win 99% of games, 94% of them with the highest score.
