This program draws cells on the screen, it is like Conway's Game of Life. These cells are being born and die depending on a set of logic rules, they form a cellular automaton. Their evolution, or artificial life, creates interesting patterns.

Instructions
The cells are represented by a * on the screen. The program asks a few questions before the drawing starts, this way the user can change the behavior of the automaton:

Choose the inital state, being:
1 for a single cell,
2 for a random set of cells
or 3 to enter the cells in hex.
Type the radius, this can be 1 or 2. This changes the amount of cells being a neighbour to each other and changes the effect of the rule.
Type the rule to follow. Read more about this here.
Note that the drawing is continues, an early screen saver.
